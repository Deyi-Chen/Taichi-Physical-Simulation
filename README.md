# Taichi Physical Simulation

A personal gallery of physics simulations implemented in Taichi.

This repository documents my journey building physical simulation systems from scratch — starting with simple mass-spring models and moving toward more advanced methods.

More coming soon.

## Implementations

### 1. Explicit Mass-Spring System

- Grid generation
- Structural + shear springs
- Explicit (semi-implicit) Euler integration
- Basic damping
- GPU accelerated (Taichi)

---

## Roadmap

- Gravity + fixed boundary cloth
- Implicit Euler (Newton solver)
- Conjugate Gradient solver
- FEM
- MPM
- Rigid body dynamics

Stay tuned.
